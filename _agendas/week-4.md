- [Today's Notes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Week-4--A8DwJMkEIeVVSLYst8dmKv54AQ-gtthSM6JeCGjSTrxFyo68)
- Small group activities day: type activity review; image demo; working on homework.

### Homework
- Sketch out 3 ideas for the design of your website. You can design at 1280px in width (flexible height, but it should be at least 720px tall). This should be pretty quick and gestural – you can use any tool you feel comfortable with. (Photo or scan of a hand drawing, illustrator, InDesign, Figma, Sketch). We’re going to be working in Figma starting with the next project, so if you’d like to start experimenting with that, go right ahead
- Begin programming your project so that I can help with any programming questions on Wednesday.
